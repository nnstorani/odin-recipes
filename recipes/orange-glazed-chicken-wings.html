        <p>Crispy, oven-baked wings get a sweet and flavorful makeover with a homemade orange-soy glaze.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 chicken wings (skin removed)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon seasoned salt</li>
            <li>8 tablespoons orange marmalade</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash hands with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Tuck the chicken wing tip under the larger joint to form a triangle.</li>
            <li>Wash hands and any surface that touched the chicken with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Heat butter in skillet (200°F on temperature-controlled gas burner).</li>
            <li>Sprinkle wings with seasoned salt and place in heated butter in skillet with tongs.</li>
            <li>Wash tongs with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li>Sauté chicken wings on temperature controlled gas burner (325°F) until evenly brown on both sides, about 20 minutes. Cook until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees on a meat thermometer.</li>
            <li>Spread with orange marmalade, continuing to sauté while basting frequently for another 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from skillet. Serve hot.</li>
            <li>Hold at serving temperature on automatic burner or in "Keep-Warm" oven set at 170°F. They will be glazed and “sticky” good.</li>
        </ol>
