        <p>Pasta e fagioli translates to “pasta and beans.” Pasta and beans may not sound terribly enticing (unless you're me), but I assure you that this Italian stew is truly irresistible.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 lb. spicy (or sweet) Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 medium carrots, peeled and finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 stalks celery, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 (15-oz.) cans Great Northern Beans</li>
            <li>1 (15-oz.) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>4 c. Swanson Chicken Broth</li>
            <li>2 sprigs rosemary, leaves finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 1/2 c. ditalini pasta (or other small shape)</li>
            <li>Freshly grated Parmesan, for garnish</li>
            <li>Freshly chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large, deep pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add sausage and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Stir in onion, carrots, and celery and cook until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Season with salt and pepper, then add in beans (with their liquid), diced tomatoes, chicken broth, and rosemary. Bring to a boil, then stir in ditalini.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and cook until pasta is al dente, about 8 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.</li>
            <li>Serve in bowls garnished with Parmesan and parsley.</li>
